## Interface Contracts

### REST API Standards
```yaml
response_format:
  success:
    status: "success"
    data: {} # Response payload
    meta: {} # Pagination, timestamps, etc.
  
  error:
    status: "error"
    error:
      code: "ERROR_CODE"
      message: "Human readable message"
      details: {} # Additional error context

http_status_codes:
  - 200: "Success"
  - 201: "Created"
  - 400: "Bad Request"
  - 401: "Unauthorized"
  - 403: "Forbidden"
  - 404: "Not Found"
  - 409: "Conflict"
  - 422: "Validation Error"
  - 429: "Rate Limited"
  - 500: "Internal Server Error"

headers:
  - "Content-Type: application/json"
  - "X-Request-ID: {uuid}"
  - "X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: {count}"
  - "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

### Event Schema Standards
```yaml
event_structure:
  id: "uuid"
  type: "domain.event_name"
  timestamp: "ISO 8601 datetime"
  version: "semver"
  source: "service_name"
  data: {} # Event payload
  metadata:
    correlation_id: "uuid"
    user_id: "uuid (if applicable)"
    trace_id: "uuid"

example_events:
  user_created:
    type: "user.created"
    data:
      user_id: "uuid"
      email: "string"
      created_at: "datetime"
  
  task_assigned:
    type: "task.assigned"
    data:
      task_id: "uuid"
      assignee_id: "uuid"
      assigned_by: "uuid"
      assigned_at: "datetime"
```

## Component Scaling Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling
```yaml
stateless_services:
  - authentication_service: "2-10 instances"
  - user_service: "2-20 instances"
  - task_service: "3-15 instances"
  - notification_service: "1-5 instances"

scaling_triggers:
  cpu_utilization: "> 70%"
  memory_utilization: "> 80%"
  request_rate: "> 1000/sec per instance"
  response_time: "> 200ms p95"

load_balancing:
  algorithm: "Round robin with health checks"
  health_check_path: "/health"
  health_check_interval: "30s"
  unhealthy_threshold: "3 consecutive failures"
```

### Data Layer Scaling
```yaml
postgresql:
  read_replicas: "3 replicas"
  connection_pooling: "PgBouncer (100 max connections)"
  partitioning: "Range partitioning for time-series data"

redis:
  cluster_mode: "6 nodes (3 master + 3 replica)"
  memory_optimization: "Key expiration and eviction policies"
  persistence: "RDB snapshots + AOF logging"

elasticsearch:
  cluster: "3 nodes minimum"
  sharding: "Time-based index sharding"
  replication: "1 replica per shard"
```

## Security Considerations

### Component Security
```yaml
authentication_service:
  - JWT signing with RS256
  - Rate limiting for auth endpoints
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
  - Session management with Redis
  - MFA support (TOTP)

inter_service_communication:
  - mTLS for service-to-service communication
  - Service mesh for traffic encryption
  - API keys for internal service authentication
  - Network policies for pod-to-pod communication

data_protection:
  - Encryption at rest (AES-256)
  - TLS 1.3 for data in transit
  - PII data encryption in database
  - Audit logging for sensitive operations
```

This component architecture provides a clear separation of concerns while enabling scalability, maintainability, and security across all system components.
