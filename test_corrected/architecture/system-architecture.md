# System Architecture Design

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive system architecture for the test project, following the SPARC methodology with claude-flow integration. The architecture prioritizes modularity, testability, and scalability while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

## Architectural Principles

### Core Principles
1. **Modular Design**: Each component < 500 lines, single responsibility
2. **Environment Safety**: No hardcoded secrets, configuration-driven
3. **Testability**: Dependency injection, mockable interfaces
4. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling, stateless services
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, tracing

### Design Patterns
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clean separation between business logic and external adapters
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Async communication via events
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation for complex data operations
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation management

## System Boundaries and Context

### Internal Systems
- **Core Application**: Business logic and domain models
- **Data Management**: Persistence and caching layers
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **Integration**: Event processing and external service communication

### External Systems
- **User Interfaces**: Web, mobile, CLI clients
- **Third-party Services**: Email, SMS, analytics providers
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud services, databases, message queues

## Technology Stack

### Backend Services
```yaml
runtime: "Node.js 18+"
framework: "Express.js with TypeScript"
validation: "Joi/Zod for schema validation"
testing: "Jest with Supertest"
documentation: "OpenAPI/Swagger"
```

### Database Layer
```yaml
primary: "PostgreSQL 14+"
cache: "Redis 7+"
search: "Elasticsearch (if needed)"
migrations: "Knex.js migrations"
orm: "Prisma or TypeORM"
```

### Infrastructure
```yaml
containerization: "Docker with multi-stage builds"
orchestration: "Docker Compose (dev), Kubernetes (prod)"
monitoring: "Prometheus + Grafana"
logging: "Winston with structured logging"
tracing: "OpenTelemetry"
```

### Security
```yaml
authentication: "JWT with refresh tokens"
authorization: "Role-based access control (RBAC)"
encryption: "bcrypt for passwords, AES-256 for data"
transport: "TLS 1.3 minimum"
secrets: "Environment variables with validation"
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of API calls
- **Throughput**: 1000+ requests/second per service
- **Concurrent Users**: 10,000+ active users
- **Database**: < 100ms query response time

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless services, load balancing
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas, connection pooling
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching (Redis, CDN)
- **Auto-scaling**: CPU/memory-based scaling triggers

### Reliability
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime target
- **Recovery**: < 5 minutes RTO, < 1 hour RPO
- **Fault Tolerance**: Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms
- **Data Consistency**: ACID transactions where needed

### Security
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Compliance**: GDPR compliance for user data

## Integration Patterns

### API Design
```yaml
style: "RESTful with GraphQL for complex queries"
versioning: "URL path versioning (/api/v1/)"
documentation: "OpenAPI 3.0 specification"
error_handling: "Consistent error response format"
rate_limiting: "Per-user and per-endpoint limits"
```

### Event-Driven Communication
```yaml
pattern: "Publish-Subscribe with event sourcing"
transport: "RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka"
serialization: "JSON with schema validation"
reliability: "At-least-once delivery guarantee"
dead_letter: "Dead letter queues for failed events"
```

### Data Integration
```yaml
synchronization: "CDC (Change Data Capture) where needed"
batch_processing: "Scheduled ETL jobs"
api_integration: "RESTful APIs with retry logic"
webhook_support: "Outbound webhooks for integrations"
```

```yaml
application_metrics: "Custom business metrics"
system_metrics: "CPU, memory, disk, network"
database_metrics: "Query performance, connection pools"
api_metrics: "Request rate, response time, error rate"
```

### Logging Strategy
```yaml

```

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Strategy
- **Development**: Local Docker Compose setup
- **Testing**: Kubernetes cluster with test data
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final testing
- **Production**: Multi-zone Kubernetes deployment

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Service configuration
- **ConfigMaps**: Application configuration
- **Secrets**: Sensitive configuration data
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime feature toggling

### Database Strategy
- **Migration Management**: Automated database migrations
- **Backup Strategy**: Daily automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region backup replication
- **Performance Monitoring**: Query performance tracking

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and secure system that can grow with business needs while maintaining high quality and performance standards.
