## 5. Acceptance Criteria

### 5.1 SPARC Workflow
```gherkin
Feature: SPARC Methodology Execution

  Scenario: Complete SPARC workflow
    Given I have a project requirement
    When I execute "npx claude-flow sparc tdd 'user authentication'"
    Then the system should complete all SPARC phases
    And generate comprehensive test suites
    And implement working code
    And provide documentation
```

### 5.2 Agent Coordination
```gherkin
Feature: Multi-agent Coordination

  Scenario: Parallel agent execution
    Given I initialize a swarm with mesh topology
    When I spawn 6 agents with different specializations
    Then all agents should coordinate through shared memory
    And execute tasks in parallel
    And maintain consistent state
```

### 5.3 Performance Requirements
```gherkin
Feature: Performance Optimization

  Scenario: Execution speed improvement
    Given I have a complex development task
    When I use parallel agent coordination
    Then execution speed should improve by 2.8-4.4x
    And token usage should reduce by 32.3%
    And achieve 84.8% problem solve rate
```
