# 🏥 Dr. House Brutal Honest Assessor - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **What is Dr. House?**

Dr. House is a **brutal honest assessor** that ensures Claude Flow agents don't produce shit work. Inspired by the brilliant but brutally honest Dr. Gregory House from the TV series, this system provides:

- **Unfiltered feedback** on code quality
- **Brutal honesty** about architectural decisions
- **No sugar-coating** of issues or problems
- **Quality thresholds** that must be met
- **Production-ready assessment** criteria

## 🚀 **Why Dr. House?**

## ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

### **Quality Threshold**
```bash
--threshold 0.8  # 80% quality required (default)
--threshold 0.9  # 90% quality required (strict)
--threshold 0.7  # 70% quality required (lenient)
```

### **Assessment Control**
```bash
--no-assessment     # Disable Dr. House assessment
--no-wfgy          # Disable WFGY methodology
--interactive      # Enable interactive mode
--quiet            # Reduce output verbosity
```

### **Project Options**

## 🔧 **Customization**

### **Custom Assessment Criteria**
You can modify the assessment functions in the scripts:

```bash
# In assess_code_quality()
if [[ ! -f "$project_dir/README.md" ]]; then
  issues+=("No README.md - This is amateur hour")
  quality_score=$((quality_score - 20))
fi
```

### **Custom Quality Thresholds**
```bash
# Adjust scoring weights
[[ -d "$project_dir/tests" ]] && quality_score=$((quality_score + 15))
[[ -f "$project_dir/.env.example" ]] && quality_score=$((quality_score + 5))
```

### **Custom Dr. House Messages**
```bash
house_roast() {
  echo -e "${RED}${BOLD}🏥 DR. HOUSE:${NC} $*"
}

house_approve() {
  echo -e "${GREEN}${BOLD}✅ DR. HOUSE:${NC} $*"
}
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**1. Assessment Too Strict**
```bash
# Lower the threshold
--threshold 0.7
```

**2. Assessment Too Lenient**
```bash
# Raise the threshold
--threshold 0.9
```

**3. False Positives**
```bash
# Disable specific checks in the assessment functions
# Modify the scoring logic
```

**4. Project Fails Assessment**
```bash
# Check the detailed report
cat DR_HOUSE_ASSESSMENT.md

# Fix the identified issues
# Re-run the assessment
```
