# üîÑ Code Refactor Orchestrator Guide

> **Transform existing codebases into new applications using Claude Flow orchestration**

## üéØ **The Real-World Problem**

Most developers don't start from scratch. Instead, they:
- **Study existing repositories** and think "what if I combined these concepts?"
- **Have local codebases** they want to adapt for new purposes
- **Want to modernize legacy code** with new architectures
- **Need to merge multiple projects** into a unified solution

The **Code Refactor Orchestrator** solves these real-world scenarios by using Claude Flow to analyze, understand, and transform existing code into new applications.

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### **1. Source Analysis**
The orchestrator analyzes your source code (GitHub repositories or local codebases) to understand:
- **Programming language** and framework
- **Architecture patterns** (monolithic, microservices, full-stack)
- **Key features** and functionality
- **Dependencies** and technical stack
- **Code structure** and organization

### **2. Target Definition**
You define what you want to create:
- **New functionality** to add
- **Architecture changes** (e.g., "convert to microservices")
- **Technology upgrades** (e.g., "modernize with React")
- **Integration requirements** (e.g., "combine with authentication service")

### **3. Intelligent Refactoring**
Claude Flow orchestrates the transformation:
- **Analyzes source code** thoroughly
- **Identifies reusable components** and patterns
- **Designs new architecture** that combines the best elements
- **Implements modern best practices**
- **Provides migration guides** and documentation

## üìä **Supported Scenarios**

### **GitHub Repository Analysis**
```bash
./06_code_refactor_orchestrator.sh \
  -n modern-chat-app \
  -t github \
  -p https://github.com/user/legacy-chat.git \
  -f "Modern React app with real-time features and microservices architecture"
```

**What it does:**
- Clones and analyzes the GitHub repository
- Understands the existing chat functionality
- Creates a modern React version with microservices
- Provides migration guide from legacy to modern

### **Local Codebase Adaptation**
```bash
./06_code_refactor_orchestrator.sh \
  -n api-gateway \
  -t local \
  -p /path/to/old-api \
  -f "API Gateway with authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring"
```

**What it does:**
- Analyzes your local API codebase
- Transforms it into a production-ready API Gateway
- Adds authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring
- Maintains existing functionality while improving architecture

### **Multi-Repository Fusion**
```bash
./06_code_refactor_orchestrator.sh \
  -n unified-platform \
  -t github \
  -p "https://github.com/user/auth-service.git,https://github.com/user/data-service.git" \
  -f "Unified platform combining authentication and data services with shared UI"
```

**What it does:**
- Analyzes multiple repositories
- Identifies common patterns and components
- Creates a unified platform architecture
- Provides integration guides

## üõ†Ô∏è **Usage Examples**
